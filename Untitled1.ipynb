       "'WASHINGTON -- Former US president Jimmy Carter is willing to go to North Korea to broker negotiations over its nuclear weapons program, the New York Times reported Sunday.In an interview at his home in Georgia, the 93-year-old Democrat said he made his intention known to President Donald Trump\\'s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, but has so far received a negative response.\"I would go, yes,\" Carter told the Times. \"I told him (McMaster) that I was available if they ever need me.\"The former president flew to Pyongyang in 1994 to seek a solution to the nuclear impasse, and again in 2010 to win the release of a detained American citizen. This AP file photo shows former US president Jimmy Carter. (Yonhap)He said the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is \"unpredictable\" and could use nuclear weapons if he feels that he is under threat from Trump.\"I think he\\'s now got advanced nuclear weaponry that can destroy the Korean Peninsula and Japan, and some of our outlying territories in the Pacific, maybe even our mainland,\" Carter said.North Korea tested two long-range missiles in July and what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb last month. That prompted Trump to unleash a series of angry threats about wiping out the regime.\"I\\'m afraid, too, of a situation,\" Carter said. \"I don\\'t know what they\\'ll do. Because they want to save their regime.\"He pointed out that China\\'s influence on North Korea is greatly overestimated, especially in the absence of any known contact between Kim and Beijing.

       "'An international human rights group is urging North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to halt forcing its people to engage in forced labor without due compensation, a report by a U.S.-based media outlet said Friday.The report carried by Radio Free Asia (RFA) said the Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Kim calling for an end to mandatory forced labor, and requested that Pyongyang become a member of the International Labor Organization under the United Nations.The move by the New York-headquartered non-governmental organization (NGO) comes as a large number of North Korean citizens were forced to work ahead of the rare Workers\\' Party of Korea\\'s congress that kicked off earlier in the day.North Korea had mobilized ordinary citizens to prepare for the congress under a \"70-day campaign of loyalty\" and forced them to work longer hours and even donate money to authorities. This has caused a rise in discontent among ordinary people, according to government officials in Seoul.The loyalty campaign also comes as the North has become ever more isolated after the U.N. slapped it with the toughest ever sanctions after the country detonated its fourth nuclear device in January and followed up on this provocation with the firing of a long-range ballistic missile.The NGO\\'s letter pointed out that Kim, who assumed power after the death of his father in late 2011, pledged numerous times to improve the livelihood of ordinary people, but so far he has not kept his promise.

       "'The United States announced retaliatory sanctions on North Korea on Friday in response to the communist nation\\'s alleged cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures, warning the actions are just the \"first aspect\" of its response.President Barack Obama signed an executive order authorizing additional sanctions on North Korean individuals and entities in response to the North\\'s \"ongoing provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies, particularly its destructive and coercive cyber attack on Sony,\" the White House said in a statement.Three North Korean entities and 10 officials were named in the sanctions, including the Reconnaissance General Bureau, Pyongyang\\'s primary intelligence organization, accused of arms trading and other activities banned under U.N. resolutions, according to the Treasury Department.Though those sanctioned are barred from using the U.S. financial system and U.S. citizens are banned from doing business with them, the measures are considered largely symbolic because the North has already been under a string of international sanctions and those newly sanctioned are not believed to have any dealings with the U.S.\"We take seriously North Korea\\'s attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a U.S. company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of restricting their\\xa0right to free expression,\" the White House said.\"As the president has said, our response to North Korea\\'s attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment will be proportional, and will take place at a time and in a manner of our choosing.Today\\'s actions are the first aspect of our response,\" it said.The FBI has determined that North Korea was behind the hack on Sony, confirming widespread suspicions pointing to the North that has expressed strong anger at a Sony movie, \"The Interview,\" which involves a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Obama has since vowed to \"respond proportionally\" to the attacks.North Korea has denied any responsibility, though it lauded the Sony hack as a \"righteous deed.\"\"The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others,\" Obama said in a letter to House of Representatives and Senate leaders.The two other newly sanctioned North Korean entities are Korea Mining Development and Trading Corp. (KOMID) and Korea Tangun Trading Corp. Eight of the 10 sanctioned individuals were KOMID officials stationed in Iran, Syria, Russia and Namibia.KOMID is the North\\'s primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons, according to the Treasury Department. The company was previously sanctioned by the U.S. and the United Nations, it said.Korea Tangun Trading Corp. is responsible for the procurement of commodities and technologies to support the North\\'s defense research and development program. The company was also a target of U.S. and U.N. sanctions, the department said.The sanctioned individuals include KOMID officials Kil Jong-hun, Kim Kwang-yon, Jang Song-chol, Kim Yong-chol, Jang Yong-son, Kim Kyu, Ryu Jin and Kang Ryong, as well as Yu Kwang-ho, a North Korean government official, and Kim Kwang-chun, a Tangun Trading Corp. official.\"Today\\'s actions are driven by our commitment to hold North Korea accountable for its destructive and destabilizing conduct,\" Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew said in a statement. \"Even as the FBI continues its investigation into the cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend U.S. businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States.\"The new sanctions also underline the confidence the U.S. has in blaming the North for the Sony hack despite growing doubts about the FBI\\'s finding among American cyber-security specialists.Last week, a cyber-security firm, Norse, was reported to have briefed the FBI on the result of its own investigation that it was not North Korea, but laid-off Sony staff members that disrupted Sony\\'s computer network.On Friday, Scott Borg, director and chief economist of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, an independent, nonprofit research institute specializing on cyber-threats and risks, also said in a commentary on the CNBC website that the skills employed in the Sony hack were too sophisticated for the North.
