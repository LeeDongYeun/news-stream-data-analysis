They launched their own group to oust Ahn and block what they called a conservative collusion.\\xa0The dissenters are largely based in the southwestern region, which has been traditionally opposed to rightist politicians. A merger with the conservative Bareun Party would dent their prospects in future elections, including the June gubernatorial and mayoral elections.\\xa0\\xa0The lower turnout is far below the quorum of a third of members required by the party constitution to determine crucial issues, such as a merger with other parties.\\xa0The poll led by Ahn\\'s faction was not directly about the merger plan but questioned whether or not the respondents support Ahn who pushes for the merger.Ahn\\'s side pointed out that the voter ratio was close to the . percent turnout of the last party election in August, in which Ahn was picked chairman.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Earlier in the day, a man barged into the party\\'s headquarters and attacked Rep. Lee Dong-seop, chief of the election committee, when he was announcing the vote result. The man kicked the podium with his leg and got into a tussle with party officials. He was taken into police custody later.\\xa0\\xa0The integration of the two parties has been seen as a strategy to combine the centrist political force to counterbalance the two major parties -- the ruling Democratic Party with  seats and the main opposition Liberty Korea Party with  seats in the -member National Assembly.The People\\'s Party holds  seats, while the Bareun Party has lawmakers.
